## Learnings from module 2

I have completed all the tasks as assigned-Priyanka Gorentla and i usually execute python scripts in visual code by selecting run python file in terminal but from this module i got to know how to run the script from anaconda prompt-

Output of useroop from anaconda prompt-

(base) C:\Users\KONGA\Documents\datafun-02-functions> python useroop.py
None
This module provides access to the mathematical functions
defined by the C standard.
Return the ceiling of x as an Integral.

This is the smallest integer >= x.
